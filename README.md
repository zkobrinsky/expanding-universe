# Expanding Universe
This program demonstrates proof of the expanding universe by utilizing Hubble's Law and pixel manipulation. It iterates through a collection of images from the [Sloan Digital Sky Survey](sdss.org), repeatedly amplifying the fact that celestial bodies are generally red in the night sky due to the fact that they are moving away from us, demonstrating Hubble's Law.
